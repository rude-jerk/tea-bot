WELCOME_MESSAGE: "Howdy! Welcome to TEA! To prevent spam bots from joining our discord we'll need to assign you a role to prevent you from getting auto-kicked. If you're a member of the guild, type /tjoin <your gw2 account> or /tregister <your gw2 api key>, /tregister is required for ranks higher than Freshman.\nFor example `/tjoin rudejerk.5978`"
BAD_USER: "Uh oh, that doesn't look like a Guild Wars 2 account name! An example account name looks like: `abcd.1234`"
NOT_GUILD_MEMBER: "It looks like either you aren't a member of TEA or the GW2 API hasn't updated yet.\nIf you are a member, check that your username is correct and try again in 5 minutes!\nIf you are not a member and would like to join, ask in `#welcome` or message a leader.\nYou've been granted the Transfer Student role for now - `/tjoin` again after joining or if you misspelled your GW2 account name to get a guild member role!"
IS_GUILD_MEMBER: "Welcome to the discord server, {user_name}. You've been granted the role `{role_name}`!"
USER_NAME_SET: "Your nickname has been updated to include your GW2 account name!"
BAD_API_KEY: "Your API key appears to be invalid, please try again with a valid API key. API keys can be generated at: https://account.arena.net/applications"
API_WENT_WRONG: "Uh oh! Looks like something went wrong with the GW2 API, or the API is down - please try again later!"
GW2_ACCOUNT_ALREADY_LINKED: "That GW2 account is already linked to another Discord user, contact an administrator."
