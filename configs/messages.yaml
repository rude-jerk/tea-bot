WELCOME_MESSAGE: "Howdy! Welcome to TEA! To prevent spam bots from joining our discord we'll need to assign you a role to prevent you from getting auto-kicked. If you're a member of the guild or regularly run content with TEA, type /tjoin <your gw2 account> or /tregister <your gw2 api key>, /tregister is required for ranks higher than Freshman.\nFor example `/tjoin rudejerk.5978`\n**If you're just visiting and don't plan to stick around, click the button below for temporary discord access.**\nIf the button does not respond or is disabled, try typing `/twelcome` to get a new one - it expires after 5 minutes."
